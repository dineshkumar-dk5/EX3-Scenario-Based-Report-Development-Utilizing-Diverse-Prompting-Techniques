## Aim:

To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

## Scenario:

### Case Study 1 ‚Äì **Straightforward Prompts (Tabular Format Prompting)**

* Used when the goal is to get **structured outputs quickly** (tables, lists, summaries).
* Helps in **avoiding ambiguity** in the response.
* Ensures data is **organized, comparable, and easily readable**.
* Best suited for **nutritional charts, schedules, product specifications, FAQs**.

üìä **Food Menu Nutritional Chart Example:**

| Dish Name       | Ingredients                          | Calories | Protein | Fat | Allergens        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------- | --- | ---------------- |
| Grilled Chicken | Chicken breast, olive oil, spices    | 250      | 30g     | 6g  | None             |
| Veggie Salad    | Lettuce, tomato, cucumber, olive oil | 120      | 4g      | 5g  | None             |
| Peanut Curry    | Peanuts, coconut milk, spices        | 350      | 12g     | 20g | Peanuts, Coconut |
| Pasta Alfredo   | Pasta, cream, cheese, butter         | 500      | 15g     | 25g | Dairy, Gluten    |

### Case Study 2 ‚Äì **Preceding Question Prompting**

* A **guided approach** where the AI is asked context-based questions first.
* Builds **better understanding of goals** before generating the final output.
* Helps avoid **irrelevant or generic answers**.
* Suitable for **campaigns, planning tasks, educational content**.

üìå **Climate Change Awareness Campaign Example:**

1. **Audience** ‚Äì Students, urban communities.
2. **Cultural factors** ‚Äì Social media usage, youth activism, eco-friendly trends.
3. **Communication channels** ‚Äì Instagram reels, YouTube shorts, workshops.
4. **Tone** ‚Äì Youthful, inspiring, action-oriented.

üìù **Campaign Output:**

* **Title:** *‚ÄúAct Now, Save Tomorrow‚Äù*
* **Medium:** Social media posts, eco-challenges, community workshops.
* **Message:** ‚ÄúSmall changes ‚Üí Big results‚Äù (plastic-free, tree planting, saving electricity).
* **Engagement:** Hashtag campaigns (#GoGreen, #ActNow).

## Algorithm:

1. Define problem scope (customer queries to be solved).
2. Select prompting technique:

   * **Straightforward Prompting ‚Üí** Use when structured, tabular data is needed.
   * **Preceding Question Prompting ‚Üí** Use when contextual, stepwise reasoning is required.
3. Frame the prompt accordingly.
4. Execute and generate AI responses.
5. Compare clarity, usefulness, and adaptability of results.
6. Optimize prompts for improved accuracy and relevance.
7. Validate outputs for chatbot integration.

## Result:

Thus, **Straightforward Tabular Prompting** gave clear structured data (food chart), while **Preceding Question Prompting** produced a context-aware, impactful climate change campaign plan. Both techniques highlight how **different prompt strategies** improve chatbot adaptability in real-world applications.
